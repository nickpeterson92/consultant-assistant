# Workflow Flow Changes Summary

## Old Flow (Problematic)
1. Search for opportunities by name directly
2. Multiple found? → Human picks
3. Check if opportunity is Closed Won
4. If not → Update to Closed Won
5. Continue with onboarding

**Problems:**
- Searched for "new customer" instead of "Express Logistics"
- Didn't handle multiple accounts with similar names
- Extra conditional check for Closed Won status

## New Enhanced Flow
1. **Search for accounts** by name (e.g., "Express Logistics")
2. Multiple accounts found? → Human picks account
3. One account found → **Search opportunities for that account**
4. Multiple opportunities found? → Human picks opportunity
5. **Always set opportunity to Closed Won** (no conditional check)
6. Continue with onboarding

**Benefits:**
- Searches accounts first (more logical)
- Handles both account and opportunity disambiguation
- Simpler flow - just sets to Closed Won regardless
- Better matches how users think about the process

## Key Variable Changes
- Removed: `opportunity_name` (was confusing)
- Added: `account_name` (extracted from user message)
- Added: `opportunity_id` (selected opportunity)

## Implementation Details
The workflow agent now:
1. Looks at the orchestrator's context for the original user message
2. Extracts the account name using LLM (e.g., "Express Logistics" from "we just inked the deal with express logistics!")
3. Uses that account name in the workflow instead of generic instructions
