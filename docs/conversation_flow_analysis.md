# Conversation Flow Analysis: Multi-Turn Context

## Test Scenario
User conversation flow:
1. "get the GenePoint account"
2. "update the SLA opportunity"  
3. "help me onboard these guys"

## Results Analysis

### Turn 1: "get the GenePoint account" ✅
- **Query Type**: balanced_query
- **Results**: Successfully retrieved GenePoint and related entities
- **Why it works**: Direct entity name match with keyword scoring

### Turn 2: "update the SLA opportunity" ✅
- **Query Type**: balanced_query  
- **Results**: SLA Contract ranked #1, correctly scoped to GenePoint
- **Why it works**: 
  - "SLA" keyword matches the opportunity name
  - Context boost from recently accessed GenePoint
  - Graph relationships help (GenePoint → SLA Opportunity)

### Turn 3: "help me onboard these guys" ✅
- **Query Type**: follow_up_query (correctly detected!)
- **Results**: Retrieved onboarding tasks for GenePoint
- **Why it works**:
  - "these guys" triggered follow-up detection
  - Weights: 50% semantic + 35% context = 85% context-aware
  - Recent access to GenePoint entities provides strong signal

## What's Working Well

1. **Adaptive Weighting**: The system correctly identified Turn 3 as a follow-up query and applied appropriate weights

2. **Context Tracking**: The memory tracks:
   - Recent queries (last 10)
   - Recently accessed nodes (last 20)
   - This maintains conversation context effectively

3. **Graph Relationships**: Connections between GenePoint → Opportunities/Tasks help retrieve related entities

4. **Semantic Understanding**: With embeddings enabled:
   - "these guys" → GenePoint (via context)
   - "onboard" → onboarding tasks

## Potential Edge Cases

### 1. Ambiguous References
```
User: "get the biotech account"
User: "show me their biggest deal"
User: "who's the main contact?"
```
**Risk**: Multiple biotech accounts could confuse context

### 2. Context Switching
```
User: "get GenePoint account"
User: "what about TechCorp?"
User: "update their opportunity"  ← Which "their"?
```
**Risk**: Context might stick to GenePoint or switch incorrectly

### 3. Time Gaps
```
User: "get GenePoint account"
[10 minutes pass]
User: "help me onboard them"
```
**Risk**: Context might decay, reducing effectiveness

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Pronoun Resolution Enhancement**
Add explicit pronoun tracking:
```python
def _track_entity_references(self, query_text: str, results: List[MemoryNode]):
    """Track which entities pronouns likely refer to."""
    pronouns = {'they', 'them', 'their', 'these', 'those', 'it', 'its'}
    if any(pronoun in query_text.lower() for pronoun in pronouns):
        # Store the primary entity from results
        if results and results[0].content.get('entity_type') == 'Account':
            self._current_account_context = results[0]
```

### 2. **Confidence Scoring**
Add confidence to context resolution:
```python
def _get_context_confidence(self, query_text: str) -> float:
    """Return confidence that context is still relevant."""
    if not self._recent_accessed_nodes:
        return 0.0
    
    # Check time since last access
    last_access_time = self._recent_accessed_nodes[-1][1]
    minutes_elapsed = (datetime.now() - last_access_time).total_seconds() / 60
    
    # Confidence decays over time
    time_confidence = max(0, 1.0 - (minutes_elapsed / 10))  # 10 min decay
    
    # Boost if query has explicit references
    has_reference = any(word in query_text.lower() 
                       for word in ['their', 'these', 'those', 'them'])
    
    return time_confidence * (1.5 if has_reference else 1.0)
```

### 3. **Multi-Entity Context**
Support multiple entities in context:
```python
# Instead of single context, track multiple
self._context_stack = deque(maxlen=3)  # Last 3 primary entities
```

## Conclusion

The current implementation handles the test conversation flow well:
- ✅ GenePoint retrieved correctly
- ✅ SLA opportunity found with proper context
- ✅ Onboarding tasks retrieved for the right account
- ✅ Context maintained throughout conversation

The adaptive weighting system successfully identifies query types and applies appropriate scoring strategies. The combination of semantic embeddings, context tracking, and graph relationships provides robust multi-turn conversation support.

### Key Success Factors
1. **Follow-up detection** triggers context-heavy scoring
2. **Recent access tracking** maintains conversation state
3. **Graph relationships** connect related entities
4. **Semantic embeddings** understand "these guys" → context

The system is production-ready for this type of conversational flow!
